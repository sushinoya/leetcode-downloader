# Leetcode Downloader

A simple script to download your fastest, accepted solutions from Leetcode!

## Usage

If you do not have [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/2.7.0/) installed, 
first run `pip install requests`
```shell
 python3 fetch_submissions.py <username>
```

## Update [29 Oct 2021]
Leetcode has recently enabled reCAPTCHA for their auth pages and that might disallow login attempts using this script. Any PRs to tackle that are welcome.
